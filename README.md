Just some code

I usually come across some interesting ideas during work.
Some of them are then archived here.
Feel free to use them, however:

These code are neither tested nor optimized. Use at your own risk.
Usually, a well engineered version is available somewhere on the internet. google/bing is your friend.

Update:
- why these code?
  - C++ dependencies are truly annoying...
    - Not any more, checkout https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg
